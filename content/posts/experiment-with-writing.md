I've been meaning to write more (actually just write) for a while now. I’ve read enough about the benefits of writing, and **it’s** time to test them out. This blog will just be a **write-up** of random things and work as a detailed “About” section for me.

I started working **full-time** as a software engineer in May 2022; **it's** been three years since. Back then I looked at my profession as just another thing that I happened to be good at—one that paid well enough to help me retire early. Over time, this view completely flipped; I started liking the job more and more.

Initially the drive came from realizing I was good at it: the kick from finishing a task, doing it well, and the praise from higher-ups kept me going. Somewhere along the way, I became obsessed with code structuring, smart abstractions, newly released language features, etc. I spent more and more of my free time reading anything software-related. By then I had concluded that I liked this profession and genuinely wanted to be good at it. I also realized I didn’t actually understand how things worked under the hood—networking, operating systems, the basics. I was carried by my ability to guess and operate on surface-level information. I tried to fix this with fundamental courses (shout-out to [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) and [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74sEFYBBRAY)). An opportunity to interview for a Production Engineer role at Meta created the urgency to finish them (alas, I failed the interviews).

I resigned from my first job last week. **In fact**, the break after this is what prompted me to start writing. The job taught me a lot. On the people side, I worked with teammates who were smart, nice, had high integrity, and were hardworking—each one of them. It was an amazing experience; I never thought I’d see all these qualities together. It kind of raised my expectations for the people I want to work with.

The job was remote at a small startup. It felt like a blessing at first—great pay, freedom to work on my own schedule at high velocity. I was sure I could pick anything up from the Internet, and the warnings about missing guidance from senior engineers were just a hoax. I was wrong.

**First problem:** missing business context. I was the only backend dev in India; the rest of the team was in SF. As the product’s complexity grew, I increasingly felt clueless about my tasks.

**Second problem:** lack of mentorship. A super-passionate engineer might not need guidance (unlikely), but most of us do. My manager was great, but the team was too small and too busy to mentor me.

After three years I quit. So far I’m very happy with the decision. I plan to join an India-based company and work from the office.

### Tech side

Golang is the primary tool of my trade—I freakin’ love its simplicity. I also enjoy the infra side of things. Terraform is my favorite tool; Docker and Kubernetes are close behind. (I wouldn’t recommend using Kubernetes unless you truly need it, but learning and running it in prod is great fun.) I did a bit of React; didn’t like it much.

I now have good clarity about what I want professionally. In the wake of AI, I want to build the tools that power consumer-facing products. I’d love to work on the platform and infrastructure behind the next big thing. I’ve learned that I don’t get much joy from non-technical tasks, even if they have huge end-user impact. My joy comes from technically challenging work and appreciation from engineering peers.

### Personal

I want more predictability and routine. I’m blessed with a loving relationship and want to make it stronger. I’m also working on reducing how much I desire—mimetic theory and all that.

Health-wise, I want a fit body and a positive relationship with food and exercise, without letting health dominate my mind. Basically, I want to want less and feel more.

Fixing my attention span and reading more are also on the list. There are so many topics—human anatomy, history, astrophysics, religion, geography, math—and I want the patience to dive deep into them.

I hope I keep enjoying writing as I go. Can’t wait to see how this journey unfolds.
